## 📋 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze raw retail sales data to identify key trends and performance metrics. By transforming messy data into a structured visual report, I’ve highlighted the core drivers of business revenue.

## 🛠️ Data Processing & Logic
To ensure the integrity of the analysis, I utilized the following logic and Excel features:

* **Custom Calculations:** Implemented the core revenue formula: 
  * $Sales = Unit Price \times Quantity$
* **Pivot Tables:** Aggregated large datasets to find the **Max**, **Min**, and **Average** sales figures.
* **Data Cleaning:** Standardized formats for Branch names and Product lines for accurate filtering.
